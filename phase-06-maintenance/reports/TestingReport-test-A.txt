Hello, I'm test-A.
To me, all the functions are worked so good, fancy and amazing looking.
But I noticed that there are still have couple issues. 
First of all, the background music sometimes didn't autoplay.
Secondly, the background picture did zoom-in when I clicked the "A" buttom, but there's nothing cord out there. So I will take this as a bug.
Beside this, all good.
Thank you, your dear test-A in the US.
